**Natural Language Processing project (Northeastern University)**<br>
This problem statement and dataset is taken from 2010 i2b2/VA challenge where we aim to extract concepts, assertions and relations from patient discharge summaries. <br>
The approach was to explore contextual word embeddings from pre-trained state of the art language models available in clinical domain such as BioBERT, Clinical BERT and NCBI BERT.<br>
We finetuned NCBI BERT for our specific task<br>
